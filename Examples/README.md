# Use cases

### Mexbalia is always at the forefront of research and development. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we developed a [Pulse-Oximeter](http://mexbalia.com/Oximetro.html) that records data in the Google cloud and before that, we created an educational project for plant monitoring and growth, called [Eden](http://mexbalia.com/Eden.html).

### Mexbalia wants to take these projects to the next level and combine them with the ConnectIoT platform as a use of case example.
